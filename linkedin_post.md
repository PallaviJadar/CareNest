- **Responsive Design**: Modern glassmorphism UI that looks great on any device.
- **Impact Focused**: Automated tracking of meals donated.

### **🛠️ Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend**: React.js & Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js & Express
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Security**: JWT & Bcrypt
- **Deployment**: Render
